Q.What is the DOM ?
DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL: Structured representation of html documents. Allow Java script to access html elements and styles to manipulate them. 
DOM is made automatically as soon as html is created and it's stored in a tree structure.

Q. How does it work then if DOM is not a part of JavaScript? 
-DOM and DOM methods are actually part of something called the web APIs. The web APIs are like libraries the browsers implement and that we can access from our JavaScript code and
that are automatically available for us to use. All these kinds of things happened behind the screen so we don't have to import or do anything.

There is actually an official DOM specifications that browsers implement which is the reason why DOM manipulation works the same in all browser.
